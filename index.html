            <p id="about-text">I graduated from the University of California,
                Davis with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematical
                Analytics and Operations Research with a minor in Economics.
                I really like math. Math is my favorite subject. I am a
                full-stack developer and I enjoy learning new programming languages.

                    <p id="main-project-text">martingale.app is an application which
                        allows a user to enter in portfolio weightings corresponding
                        to each stock in their portfolio. From there, the application
                        will calculate the exact amount of stock to buy and sell for each
                        position to properly align the portfolio with its weightings.
                        Each user has their own account and can save one portfolio. The 
                        application uses a NoSQL MongoDB database for its backend and the 
                        frontend uses React. Click on the picture above to use the 
                        application. Since the code is proprietary, I have not 
                        included a Github repository.

                        and cryptocurrency prices. The application
                        uses Axios to access a third party API, namely the sec.gov REST API
                        to access a hedge fund by its CIK number and then calculate the number
                        of stock positions that the hedge fund has either added or subtracted.
                        For the stock prices and the cryptocurrency prices, the application 
                        again uses Axios to access the IEX REST API for stock prices and the
                        Coinbase REST API for cryptocurrency prices. The application uses a MySQL
                        database for the backend. Click the picture to use the application. The Github link is below.
